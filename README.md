### 👋 Hi there, I'm Kavya!

I'm a B.Com Computer Applications graduate from the University of Madras with a passion for technology and learning.

🔹 I’m currently exploring:
- Python programming 🐍  
- Web development basics (HTML & CSS) 🌐  
- Git & GitHub for version control 🗂️  

💡 I'm a beginner, but I’m eager to grow by building small projects and collaborating with others in the developer community.

📫 Let's connect and learn together!
